# iceberg-dark
Theme for various programs, designed with love for [iceberg.vim](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim) theme. 

Meant to replace iceberg.vim in places, where original theme is hard to read.
## Currently supported:
### [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim):

Original iceberg theme: ![old](screenshots/lightline_old.png)

iceberg-dark theme: ![new](screenshots/lightline_new.png)

Installation via [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug): put `Plug 'gkeep/iceberg-dark'` in your init.vim/.vimrc and run `:PlugInstall` to install the theme.

Then put `let g:lightline = { 'colorscheme': 'icebergDark' }` in your init.vim/.vimrc to enable the theme.
